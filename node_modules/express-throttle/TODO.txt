Multiple rate limits: Achieved by multiple throttles

For example, this implements an hourly rate limit with a per-minute burst rate limit:
@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='100/m')
@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='1000/h')

Example of limiting Brute Force attacks: https://django-ratelimit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html

Example of shared rate limiting vs global. Nginx Zones

Why?
* Fun
* More flexible
